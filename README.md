BLE-Statusbar-iBeacon-simulator
===============================

Makes your Macbook/iMac to behave like an iBeacon

* The <a href="iBeaconSimulator.zip"">Mac OS Binary</a> is included in the repository

If you start the app, it places itself in the status bar

You can turn the text off ...

And when it´s sending (advertising), you see it as a binking antenna

All that can be set up in the settings

And who doesn´t know what all these fields (UUID, major, ...) mean ... I tried to explain it in a normal language ;-) ... you see the description by tapping the ? button

Have fun

feedback´s welcome

P.s. I´m currently developing some cool stuff and cocoapods (cocoapods.org) for iBeacons. But I´m an iOS developer, so that´s my first Mac app ...
